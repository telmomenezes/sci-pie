# sci-pie

Sci-pie is a collection of tools aimed at processing, analyzing and generating visualizations of repositories of scientific publications. It is being written for the MDTS11 data challenge (http://iscpif.fr/tiki-index.php?page=mdtschallenge), but I hope it can remain useful after this event.
